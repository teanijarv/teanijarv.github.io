My PhD journey in Sweden continues to be challenging yet enriching and fulfilling. While balancing personal life with doing a PhD can sometimes be complicated, having my partner Ally really helps as she is going through similar struggles throughout her final year of her PhD studies. Though travel took a backseat this year, a significant milestone was achieved with my house purchase in Estonia.</p> <h2 id="phd-growing-pains--small-victories">PhD: growing pains &amp; small victories</h2> <p>The comfort of saying “I’m just a first-year PhD student” has passed, and while expectations have grown, so has my confidence (a bit). The occasional imposter syndrome still visits my conscience, but I’ve noticed how my accumulated knowledge and skills within the field of neurodegenerative diseases and neuroimaging are finally starting to click together. The interdisciplinary and enthusiastic lab environment and supportive supervisors have been instrumental in my increased confidence. The patience of my supervisors with my sometimes unconventional ideas has been remarkable - many weird ideas and seemingly naive questions have been met with constructive feedback, shaping me into a more well-rounded researcher. Beyond that, the support among fellow PhD students has been invaluable. I feel that we have a strong support system where one can easily express their issues to each other and most often everyone has been at a similar situation before and can share their experiences and insights. There’s something deeply reassuring about knowing that these moments of doubt and struggle aren’t personal shortcomings but rather universal experiences in the PhD journey, each of us processing them in our own way.</p> <p>In comparison to the initial plans, my thesis topic has changed a bit. Nevertheless, I’m now putting the finishing touches on my first manuscript, but I can’t help but to reflect on what a rollercoaster this project has been. Initially, we faced the humbling experience of finding no evidence for our primary hypothesis, and we were prepared to publish it as a null-finding but eventually we developed a secondary hypothesis which provided some remarkable findings. This is what’s cool about science - you conceptualise, gather and analyse the data, and interpret the findings, and it can confirm or not confirm your initial hypotheses and sometimes even lead you down to a new unexpected path. While this detour extended the timeline of the project, the excitement of these discoveries made the wait worthwhile. Still, I won’t sugarcoat it - there were days when I left the lab feeling completely defeated and just thinking that I will never finish it. The key is remembering those tiny breakthrough moments that make it all worthwhile. Looking ahead, I’m already diving into my second project which I’m very excited about, and I’m feeling optimistic about my half-time review seminar later this new year.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3 d-flex align-items-stretch"> <div class="col-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024/fig1-1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 h-100" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Reproducibility retreat @ Smygehamn, Sweden </div> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024/fig1-2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 h-100" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Summer retreat with our lab @ Lund, Sweden </div> </div> <div class="col-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig1-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024/fig1-3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 h-100" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> MultiPark retreat @ Lund, Sweden </div> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="finding-balance-travelling--countryside-home">Finding balance: travelling &amp; countryside home</h2> <p>Northern European summers remain unmatched with their endless daylight and just perfect temperatures (and people actually look like they are enjoying their lives for once!). Ally and I took a well-deserved break, splitting our time between our Swedish home, a getaway trip to the Netherlands, and visiting friends and family in Estonia. September brought a life-changing decision - purchasing an old farmhouse in the Estonian countryside. While it needs substantial renovation before becoming habitable, it represents a dream for my whole family: a permanent residence for my parents who’ve always yearned for a quiet life at the countryside, and a summer retreat for me and Ally until we need a more permanent place to settle down. And of course my younger brother who is “super eager” to do a lot of physical labor at the house while I’m here in Sweden! The winter holidays were spent quietly in Lund, embracing the cozy indoor “rotting on the couch” that suits the grey season. While we postponed a trip to Estonia to spring or summer, we enjoyed quality time with some friends, including a week-long visit from a close friend and a memorable New Year’s Eve dinner.</p> <div class="l-screen"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig2_1-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig2_1-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024/fig2_1-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024/fig2_1-1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null;

Before moving to Australia and being hired as a Research Assistant in a mental health and neuroscience institute, I had no specific plans of working in research, but that changed after I got a glimpse of the enjoyment of doing science for a year. I owe a huge thanks to my mentor and boss at the institute, who recognised my potential and hired me in the first place and plainly stated that not pursuing a PhD would be a big mistake. Thereby, early this year after graduating my Master’s, I started applying for PhD programs, which turned out to be quite a long but worthwhile process.</p> <p>I knew I wanted to work with functional MRI and brain aging and my number one preference was to join the Clinical Memory Research Unit at Lund University to work on the BioFinder study investigating Alzheimer’s disease and guess what - since August, I’m now a PhD student at the very same lab doing exactly what I was aiming to.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s2-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s2-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s2-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s2-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> My graduation ceremony @ Tallinn, Estonia </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s2-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s2-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s2-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s2-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Family visit @ Lund, Sweden </div> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="travelling-and-vacation-during-summer">Travelling and vacation during summer</h2> <p>Knowing my time in Australia was limited, I sought to experience as much as possible - music concerts, hikes in the nature, and casual get-togethers with friends. It felt bittersweet to leave the Sunshine Coast which location-wise was a dream come true and I miss all the buddies I had met there. I quit my job in the institute in June to take a long holiday before my move to Sweden and did some travelling.</p> <p>Firstly, I did some travelling within Australia. I went on a trip to Sydney with my partner to have one last trip together before I head off to my solo travels and move together later to Sweden. After that, I flew to Tasmania to visit my long-time Estonian buddy who invited me to Australia in the first place - he introduced me to the wonders of Tassie and we went on multiple breathtaking hikes. Secondly, I went on a solo trip to Bali, Indonesia which was full of hiking, sightseeing, and trying to survive in the crazy traffic. Finally, I got back to Estonia just on time for my best friend’s birthday party which was a proper introduction back to Europe. In Estonia, I spent time with my family, partied with many good friends and really just tried to unwind and kill some precious neurons (that I did successfully).</p> <p>I knew I needed to take that time off before I start my PhD as I expect the next four years I will most probably not have much time off to live without carrying my research projects in the back of my head with me all the time. Now, I can live through Swedish winter with my partner with more excess vitamin D put aside.</p> <div class="l-screen"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s1-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s1-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s1-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s1-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null;

My supervisors are highly successful researchers best in their field and all my peers are super intelligent high-achievers, thereby it has its pros and cons as I know I will fulfil my potential of becoming a great researcher, but at the same time it puts a lot of stress on you as well due to everyone being highly productive and successful in their work and intuitively I often feel I start comparing myself to others too often, which I definitely need to work on the upcoming years.</p> <p>The main aim of my PhD project is to investigate early brain functional changes of the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. Probably during the upcoming year I will be working with ultra-high field functional MRI to examine in detail how decline in associative memory and executive task performance is associated with brain activation and functional connectivity, but currently I have been working on another project related to atypical tau pathology progression in Alzheimer’s disease and how it is related to the functionality and structure of the brain. I also have been working on finding biomarkers for synaptic degeneration and dysfunction using diffusion MRI, which I want to finish soon.</p> <p>In addition to all the work, in October, I also had the opportunity to attend a 5-day functional MRI workshop at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Boston, USA. I am very grateful that my supervisors deemed it viable for me to go as it has given me a lot of confidence in my knowledge of the topic discussed. I think I have already emphasised enough how much I love travelling - moreover, this was my first time visiting the States. I also managed to celebrate my birthday there with a friend I made at the course and after the course ended I went on a short vacation to visit the famous New York City and my fitness tracker was definitely happy with the amount of steps I put in every day there.</p> <p>In addition to working on my PhD projects, I have also been involved in multiple projects from my previous place of work in Australia including using EEG measures for detecting dementia risk in healthy older adults and predicting treatment response of low-dose ketamine for suicidality and depression.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s3-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s3-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s3-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s3-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="a-new-chapter-once-again">A new chapter once again</h2> <p>With the first half of the year, I was living and working in Australia and I definitely felt the most active and healthy I have ever been in my life (constant sunshine works wonders). During my long holiday, I got rid of all my responsibilities for a while and it was necessary for my mental health to completely do a factory reset to my brain and actually crave for routine and work towards the end of June. And then I moved to Lund, Sweden which is a cute little university town with population around 100k - perfect for not having too many distractions, but not being bored in case I wanted to go out as well.</p> <p>This might diverge from the focus of my annual blog post, but I just feel I need to mention how crazily fast the world is changing technology-wise. The start of generative AI boom has really taken off in sometimes a bit scary notes, but I stay positive that these new tools need to be used. I feel I am already quite dependent on this new tools and I think that it is natural - just like we have been relying on search engines for the past decade for gathering information from the internet, I reckon this is the next important step towards an upgrade of our extended brain.</p> <p>I’m back in a good work routine, but I’ve found it challenging to maintain an active lifestyle and healthy diet, so I have some of the most common new year’s resolutions this year - do more workouts and improve my diet because I know I am capable of doing that and being much more happy with myself as my time in Australia proved me.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s4-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s4-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023/s4-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023/s4-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Christmas get-together with my best friends and partner in my new home, Sweden </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name>Toomas Erik Anijärv</name></author><category term="annual-review"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 was the most eventful year of my life so far - my stay in Australia came to an end, had a long holiday where I travelled a lot and hanged out with my best friends, and started a PhD project in Sweden.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Chapter XXV - Terra Australis, 2022</title><link href="https://teanijarv.github.io/blog/2022-terra-australis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter XXV - Terra Australis, 2022"/><published>2023-01-26T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-26T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://teanijarv.github.io/blog/2022-terra-australis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://teanijarv.github.io/blog/2022-terra-australis/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-body-outset"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/2022_thumbnail-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/2022_thumbnail-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/2022_thumbnail-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/2022_thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="moving-down-under">Moving down under.</h2> <p>It was the end of January or February when my friend who has been living in Australia for a couple of years called to catch up. We were just bantering around and he just jokingly invited me to come and live in Australia for a while. Surprisingly, I agreed and in the same week I applied for a visa and bought plane tickets shortly after for March.</p> <p>This definitely was both the most spontaneous and impactful decision in my life to date, as after I arrived to the new continent, I found a job at a very cool and innovative mental health and neuroscience institute, <a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute">the Thompson Institute of University of the Sunshine Coast</a>. This was perfect as my friend was living in the warm and scenic Sunny Coast and I could just move in to the spare room at the place he was staying. The Sunshine Coast is definitely the most breathtaking place I have ever been - golden beaches, lots of greenery (and palm trees!), and is not too busy. Perfect for an active lifestyle and vitamin D.</p> <div class="l-screen"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s1-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s1-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s1-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s1-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null;

Meeting my partner, making new friends, evening runs with housemates, Billie Eilish and Tame Impala concerts in Brisbane, the latest Harry Potter play in Melbourne - these are just some of the awesome experiences I have had so far.</p> <p>I’ve had this weird and crazy idea in my mind throughout the past year that I should dream of being an astronaut or going to space one day. I want to emphasise that it is not a goal, but a dream, so I am specifically not doing anything towards to achieve it, however, if I had the chance to go to space, I would probably do it.</p> <p>So this year I did something which I consider the most out of my comfort zone and craziest thing I have ever done - I flew a small plane! Yes, I actually flew it myself. I had approximately 30 minutes of air time during which I controlled the plane independently and even got to land afterwards (however, my instructor did most of the work here). The feeling of controlling the very object that is keeping you in the sky was both frightening and exciting - a full adrenaline rush. One day I would love to have a recreational pilots license.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s2-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s2-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s2-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s2-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s2-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s2-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s2-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s2-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="entering-the-research-space">Entering the research space.</h2> <p>I got employed by the Thompson Institute (TI) as a research assistant. I am really glad that my supervisor, the director of the institute, has been super supportive of my time here and has given me a lot of freedom to explore the methods I would like to learn and research I would like to do.</p> <p>My main responsibilities at the institute have been processing and analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. I had learned about signal processing during my university studies, but the amount I have learned during the past 9 months at the TI is tremendous. My supervisor has assisted me in theory and with asking the right research questions, whereas I have done the practical work by creating an EEG pipeline for the institute. This pipeline can be found on my personal GitHub page as <a href="https://github.com/teanijarv/EEG-pyline">‘EEG-pyline’</a> and it currently includes various resting state analyses and auditory oddball event-related potential analysis.</p> <p>I was able to publish one first-author paper this year (still in final review process) about EEG spectral changes on depression and suicidality. Additionally, I am glad to have been (and still be) part of several other projects at TI including healthy ageing and youth mental health. Oh, and I attended my first neuroscience conference in Melbourne!</p> <div class="l-page-outset"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s3-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s3-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s3-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s3-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="masters-degree-check-next-up-phd">Master’s degree, check. Next up, PhD!</h2> <p>I successfully completed my Master studies in Medical Technology and Physics with ‘cum laude’ (GPA 4.67/5.00). My thesis was based on the same work as my first-author article I mentioned before, with the title “Long-term electrophysiological changes and relationship with clinical and biochemical measures following a 6-week low-dose oral ketamine treatment in adults with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality”. So, that is done now - what next?</p> <p>When I look back at the past couple of years, I see myself constantly trying to figure out what kind of work I find most rewarding. Working as a research assistant for a while, I understood that I enjoy research work a lot. The very basic idea of doing science is novel and important, but more specifically the (ideally) selfless and (mostly) unbiased development of human civilisation is what keeps me in academia for at least the next 3-5 years while I complete my doctoral studies.</p> <p>Doing a PhD definitely was not my plan just a year ago. I have always thought about it, but never had any specific plans for it. However, after supporting some interesting projects with their EEG endeavours, I felt the need for more responsibility - now I know that I want to start a PhD and have a project of my own. There is a list of topics I am interested in - for example, different neuroimaging methods (e.g., fMRI, EEG, etc), neuromodulation, brain (and body) ageing, and the list goes on. So, if you are a lab manager or know any vacancies matching my research interests, please let me know!</p> <h2 id="23-already-looks-promising">‘23 already looks promising</h2> <p>In addition to defending my thesis now in January ‘23, the new year has proven to be already quite busy. The first month of the year is not even over yet, but I have gone fishing in the ocean where I caught my first fish ever (one of them was a huge Mahi Mahi!), attended an Arctic Monkeys concert (my second one) in Brisbane and went to watch the tennis at the Australian Open in Melbourne.</p> <p>Super grateful again for all the people around me - my partner, family and close friends from both Estonia and Australia. I hope to visit my home country this year some time and also figure out what I will do next. It is funny how life is just full of ‘figuring outs’.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> <div class="l-page-outset"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s4-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s4-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s4-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s4-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Plant-based burger marathon with the lad who invited me to this continent @ Sunny Coast </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s4-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s4-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2022/s4-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2022/s4-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> At a special event with my best friends just before I left for Australia @ Estonia </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name>Toomas Erik Anijärv</name></author><category term="annual-review"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is like a challenge for myself to keep my life interesting and constantly changing to gain new experiences and thereby the subjective nature of time passing slows down - that way you can live “longer”.

My main mission, finishing my Master studies, is almost passed. I’ve almost completed all the courses in the curriculum but I’m not too sure on the topic of my final thesis yet. I don’t want to rush making it because it has to be a subject I’m really interested in. Throughout the two years of medical technology studies, I’ve come to understand my main interests in the field. When I started my studies, I had no clue how large and complex this industry is. At this point, neurotechnology feels most intriguing to me but it’s still taking the first baby steps in the medical field, so there’s a lot of research to be done.</p> <p>Because I’m about to graduate soon, I’ve been thinking a lot about where I want to work for the next couple of years. I still love the idea of working in a small start-up, but some part of me wants to try working in a hospital to work with medical professionals and get my hands on various medical imaging modalities. I’m still in the process of finding the perfect next chapter in my career, but I’m sure everything will work out perfectly.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/summerschool-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/summerschool-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/summerschool-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2021/summerschool.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="i-moved-to-milan-to-study-biomedical-engineering-abroad">I moved to Milan to study biomedical engineering abroad.</h2> <p>I’ve studied a lot this year, well at least most of the year. In the first half of ’21, I was still at my home university in Tallinn. In June I got an acceptance letter for one-semester exchange studies in Politecnico di Milano. Thereby, I took the summer off – stayed with my family in Viljandi and played a lot of tennis. In September I moved to Italy. These four months in here so far have been an experience I would recommend to anyone who has the chance. Living in a foreign country and making friends from different cultures gives some new interesting perspectives to life.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/politecnico1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/politecnico1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/politecnico1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2021/politecnico1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>I didn’t move to Italy because of the country, but the specific university. This school has an extensive biomedical engineering track – I took courses like ’Neuroengineering’ about deep learning, computational neuroscience, rehabilitation robotics, and neuroprostheses, and ’Clinical Technology Assessment’ about clinical trial design, medical technology evaluation, and clinical literature review. I also participated in a biosignal processing laboratory where I learned a few new signal processing techniques. A lot of studying happened this year and I feel I’m going in the right direction with my education.</p> <div class="l-screen"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/september-duomonight1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/september-duomonight1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/september-duomonight1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2021/september-duomonight1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null;

Seeing the city or visiting a museum on Wednesday, sipping spritz in a bar on Thursday, attending a massive campus party on Friday, dancing in a nightclub on Saturday – this was the general routine, crazy to think about it now.</p> <p>In October, I had some friends from home visiting me for my birthday – we went out with my exchange friends and had a blast. Right after this, I had an amazing one-week trip to Sicily with another group of friends from Estonia. The regular life felt like a distant dream in there and my favorite part was the day-long boat ride on the Mediterranean – what else do you need from life, right?</p> <p>November was the month of midterms, so I studied a lot because I hadn’t studied enough the previous two months. Fortunately, I aced every exam and it felt great.</p> <p>In December, before going home for Christmas, I finally went to see a football match at San Siro stadium which I planned to do since I arrived in Milan, and the day after I attended a concert by my favorite pianist Ludovico Einaudi. The same week I went to Rome and played tourist in there for a few days – it was like an open-air museum, a picturesque city. The group of friends I made during the start of the exchange period has had a huge impact on my experiences in Italy – I’m grateful.</p> <h2 id="nothing-beats-home-though">Nothing beats home though.</h2> <p>In December, I went back to Estonia for two weeks. The emotions of being back home after a while were sweet – playing cards with my family in the evening, winning or losing to my bro in FIFA, having a sauna night with my good friends, preparing a fancy dinner and getting drunk as a tradition at the end of each year with my best friends, and seeing other friends who I hadn’t seen for a couple of months now. New friends in Italy are awesome, but the connection with my best friends in Estonia is special and I don’t want to lose it.</p> <div class="l-page-outset"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/est1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/est1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/est1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2021/est1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/est2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/est2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2021/est2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2021/est2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="new-years-eve-in-malta-was-quite-vivid">New Year’s Eve in Malta was quite vivid.</h2> <p>The New Year was greeted with much sincerity and happiness in Malta.

All these things made me realize that I need to change my path a bit - I didn’t work on this project with passion lately and in that sense it wasn’t fair for anybody. In late spring, I told the team that I was partly leaving the team and found myself a replacement. Now more than half a year later, I feel great that I made this decision for myself.</p> <h2 id="i-graduated-university-and-published-my-first-scientific-article">I graduated university and published my first scientific article.</h2> <p>The pandemic and leaving most of my responsibilities at the Agency meant that I had more time to focus on completing my Bachelor’s thesis and when the whole country was locked and schools were closed, I still spent my full days alone at the university laboratory. I loved it. Working on the thesis was really fun because I got to choose the topic that interests me the most and study it. Moreover, thanks to my supervisors I got the chance to extend this thesis to write my first scientific article on our work - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUCON51174.2020.9316487">“Requirements to Data Acquisition and Signal Analysis for Electrical Grid Condition Monitoring”</a>.</p> <p>So, in spring, I defended my thesis and got my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Power Engineering and Mechatronics; in summer, I worked hard on the article; in autumn, I presented the article at the 2020 IEEE 61st International Scientific Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering of Riga Technical University (via Zoom of course..). Getting a first publication with my name on it still feels good as I wouldn’t had imagined it a year ago.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/graduation-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/graduation-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/graduation-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2020/graduation.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="finally-i-moved-to-a-new-apartment-and-made-some-other-big-decisions">Finally, I moved to a new apartment and made some other big decisions.</h2> <p>I also moved out of our “startup home office apartment“ and spent the summer in my hometown, at my grandma’s. I was looking for a new apartment and a job and applied to Master studies in Tallinn. It was kind of a difficult time for me as I wasn’t totally sure if I had made the right decisions and some days just felt pointless and unproductive (but I had a lot of fun too!). Thankfully, I got accepted to university to study Medical Technology and Physics, I found a really awesome apartment at Newton Studios in Tallinn which is a co-living space with table tennis room, gym and fun and ambitious neighbors and I got job at <a href="https://www.triumf.health/">Triumf Health</a>.</p> <p>The “whole new page” transition in my life was starting to work out just like I had imagined. Life at Newton’s is amazing, I have made some new friends here with who I can have regular coffee mornings or tea evenings and play table tennis together, so even if I stay at home the whole day, I still get to socialize too. And of course, benefits of living alone - finally I get to enjoy it!</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/newton-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/newton-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/newton-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2020/newton.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="ive-been-more-aware-of-my-doings-than-ever">I’ve been more aware of my doings than ever.</h2> <p>The whole realization about the path of my life came thanks to my diary which I started to write daily at the start of 2020. Writing about thoughts, emotions, activities every day made me aware that I want to study something related to medicine and technology, do research and work in a healthtech or medtech startup. Mind-mapping is important! All of these things are covered right now and I’m freaking grateful for this. I’m really a nerd in school as I’ve studied a lot during the first semester and so far everything has been very interesting. It has been hard but studying by feeding my curiosity makes the learning process fun and effective. However, I’m still not sure on what are the specific topics which I want to focus on yet. So far, I’m keen on neurology and neuroimaging, but this can change too.</p> <p>Working at Triumf suits me perfectly as my workhours are flexible and it’s totally remote. For example, if necessary I get a day off because of school to focus on studying. The whole mission about supporting children’s mental health through a mobile game is genuine, so I love the work.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/diary-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/diary-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2020/diary-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2020/diary.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="not-quite-sure-if-i-should-sleep-more-and-gain-control-over-my-addictions">Not quite sure if I should sleep more and gain control over my addictions.</h2> <p>Talking about medicine and health a lot here but what about myself? Well, in 2019 I quit smoking and so far it’s been good. My main addiction now is nicotine pads, I’m really addicted to these things and they play with blood pressure quite a lot, so it affects my sleep quality. I also started eating meat again (try not to when living with your grandma for 2 months!). I’m running now more often again and even completed David Goggins’ 4x4x48 challenge where I ran 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours - in total, I ran 85 km in 48 hours. This was crazy! In overall, I feel good physically but I don’t sleep much, so this is something to improve the upcoming year.</p> <h2 id="im-grateful">I’m grateful.</h2> <p>I have a small circle of great friends and my family to be grateful for. You keep me sane and make me realize that working is not everything there is in life, but it’s a big part of it. Surround yourself with people who are similar to you but have their own perspectives. This gives you a more complete picture of the world around you. Your job is not to work at something which generates you only money, but also real-time happiness. Devotion to a meaningful and happy life - that is something I learned during this year.</p> <p>Have nice one!</p>]]></content><author><name>Toomas Erik Anijärv</name></author><category term="annual-review"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[2020 started out normally.

I started my journey to become a mechatronics engineer and for now I’m totally sure that I don’t want to be a mechatronics engineer when I finish my degree. However, I don’t regret that I chose this program because I have gained many amazing opportunities thanks to it. I’ve always managed to get away in university without putting too much time in it. Yes, you might think I’m lazy but I just find so many new professional priorities all the time and therefore school is left in the background quite often. However, the last semester has been busier than ever and I have this curse/blessing which makes me perform best when I’m multiprocessing – I need to have many projects going on at the same time. This keeps me in a constant routine where I can’t seem to find excuses to skip tasks. Thanks to that, my GPA has skyrocketed and I’m probably going to start getting scholarship again.</p> <h2 id="building-a-successful-startup-is-about-consistency--im-still-dedicated-to-follow-that-rule">Building a successful startup is about consistency – I’m still dedicated to follow that rule.</h2> <p>Living together with two friends who are also your business partners might get tense sometimes but mostly it’s the best thing that has happened when you’re in a startup phase. As putting in constant effort to your newborn company is vital to create a sustainable business, it’s perfect to live together with your team. Whenever there is a lack of motivation in me, I can always count on these mates to give me some of their energy. Living together makes the team feel more united and following the same path is easier than going to regular office and do that 9-to-5 routine.</p> <p>Our platform repArtist has grown significantly. It’s been about year and a half since it all started. We had some serious difficulties with our previous developer and at the beginning of the year, we had no-one who was responsible for the tech-side. Fortunately, a new member of the team found his way to us to continue building the best platform for ambitious musicians who seek to find new partners around the globe. We have 247 artists from 12 countries and our business model has proved itself to be working. So much failing, learning, succeeding and I can say – the only way is up!</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/repa-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/repa-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/repa-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2019/repa.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="another-project-yea-thats-right--its-time-for-some-electric-bikes">Another project?

Therefore, I know I have to carefully pick my projects – this was one of the chosen ones. It started when I saw an advertisement about an electric bicycle uphill competition hosted by Cleveron. I put together a team of friends with who we built an electric bamboo bicycle called “Electric Recycle”. We won the crowd’s favorite title with this bike. Some time passed and we decided to continue on with this project, but this time it’s even more serious. The new name is Huella which means “footprint” in Spanish. The bike has a new concept design ready and the prototype is expected to be rideable in spring 2020.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/huella-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/huella-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/huella-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2019/huella.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="books-and-new-skills-have-kept-me-sharp-and-still">Books and new skills have kept me sharp and still.</h2> <p>I’ve always been keen on graphic design. 10 years ago I created my own small video games and loved doing the artwork. However, I hadn’t had the chance to keep this skill up-to-date, until now. As repArtist platform needed and still needs design updates and content (and as I was invited to the team to be “the content-creator” which I’m not..), it was obvious responsibility for me to take on all the design challenges. After many hours and almost a year later, I can say that I’ve acquired 80% of UX/UI designing skill to be a professional. Hell, I even mentored an intern who is actually studying the subject in a university. Like I said before, I don’t want to become a mechatronics engineer but I’m glad I chose this field to study in university. Thanks to that, I started this electric bamboo bicycle project with my friends and was accepted as a data analyst intern at Eesti Energia (Enefit Green).</p> <p>This internship led me back to one of my old hobbies again – programming (remember the part I told you I created small video games when I was small). I learned a lot. By using Python language, I was part of a two-man team to build a live machine learning platform for predicting malfunctions and power production of wind turbines. That’s sounds pretty rad, right? It was quite heavy at first but eventually I learned to enjoy running into problems and finding solutions.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/enefit-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/enefit-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/enefit-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2019/enefit.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>As I went through an emotional crisis at the beginning of the summer, I found that books helped me overcome it (and of course my close friends as well!). Especially important was Mark Manson’s “Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck” which made me think more clearly and aim to turn negative experiences into positive ones by learning from my mistakes. I’ve always thought I have everything under control but this emotional drama got me for good and now I’m more aware of my mood states. Two other great books get mentioned – “Sapiens: A Brief History Of Humankind” by Yuval Noah Harari and “Educated” by Tara Westover. Harari’s book should be required reading for high school pupils as it makes history plain and simple with many references which can guide to go deeper on topics which seem more interesting for the reader. “Educated” was the most inspiring story I’ve ever read. Tara Westover’s life has been full of opportunities that she has created for herself by following her own dreams, not the others’.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/raamatud-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/raamatud-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/raamatud-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2019/raamatud.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="im-freaking-healthy--i-have-quit-smoking-and-become-a-flexitarian">I’m freaking healthy – I have quit smoking and become a flexitarian.</h2> <p>In September, I had a blast in Turkey. It mostly consisted of drinking tea and smoking. By smoking I mean way too much smoking (like 1.5 packs a day) and I decided I’m not going to die because of that. I quit smoking the day after I left Turkey and replaced the habit with drinking more tea – shoutout to my Turkish buddies!</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/Turkey-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/Turkey-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2019/Turkey-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2019/Turkey.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Furthermore, I decided to try on going vegan for a month. It was easier than I expected. I even loved how my friends bullied me (extra attention, my favorite). It has been more than 2 months since I started the diet and nope, I’m not a vegan anymore because I’m not rich. Therefore, I have continued to be vegetarian/flexitarian and I don’t know whether it’s placebo effect or not but I’m feeling more energetic and my skin has gotten much better. I might still eat meat some day but I don’t really have the need for it.</p> <h2 id="final-notes">Final notes.</h2> <p>2019 was marvelous and 2020 is going to be legendary (like Barney Stinson says it) and I’m going to get most of my dopamine from self-improvement, developing products which are good for people and the environment and from school as well (in case my mom is going to read this post).</p> <p>Have a good one!</p>]]></content><author><name>Toomas Erik Anijärv</name></author><category term="annual-review"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not just another year coming to an end but it’s the season finale for the whole decade.
