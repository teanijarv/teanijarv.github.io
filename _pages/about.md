I am a biomedical engineer with interests in neuroscience and neurotechnology. I recently obtained a Master's degree in **Medical Technology and Physics** from TalTech University in Estonia and currently work as a research assistant at the [Thompson Institute of University of the Sunshine Coast](https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute) in Australia :australia:.

My current research interests include examining different **electroencephalography (EEG)** methods as biomarkers for **depression**, **suicidality**, **ageing**, and **cognition**. Most of my EEG-related code for signal processing and analysis can be found on my GitHub as [EEG-pyline: EEG pipeline in Python](https://github.com/teanijarv/EEG-pyline/). Furthermore, I am eager to learn more about other neuroimaging methods (e.g., fMRI, MRS, MEG, NIRS), neuromodulation (e.g., TMS, TDCS, DBS), machine/deep learning, and neuroscience in general.

Besides my active involvement with neuroscience and biomedical engineering, I am interested in ageing and longevity research, history, and space exploration.

The next milestone in my career is doing a PhD. Thereby, I am actively looking for a project for my upcoming PhD journey. :nerd_face:
