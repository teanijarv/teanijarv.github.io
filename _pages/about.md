I'm a PhD student in the field of neuroimaging and Alzheimer's disease at the [Clinical Memory Research Unit in Lund University](https://biofinder.se) :sweden:. Furthermore, I'm an Adjunct Fellow at the [Thompson Institute of University of the Sunshine Coast](https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute) in Australia :australia:. I have a background in biomedical engineering and have obtained a Master's degree in **Medical Technology and Physics** from Tallinn University of Technlogy :estonia:.

During my PhD, I'm investigating the **early brain functional changes of Alzheimer's disease continuum using functional ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**. My other research interests include examining different **electroencephalography (EEG)** methods as biomarkers for **depression**, **suicidality**, **aging**, and **cognition**. :nerd_face:

Most of my code for MRI data analysis can be found on my GitHib as [mribrew](https://github.com/teanijarv/mribrew). My signal processing and analysis work with EEG is available as [EEG-pyline: EEG pipeline in Python](https://github.com/teanijarv/EEG-pyline/). I've also created a Python package [HLR - Hierarchical Linear Regression](https://github.com/teanijarv/HLR) which allows researchers to perform hierarchical regression with ease in Python using Pandas dataframes. :man_technologist:

Besides my active involvement with neuroscience and neuroimaging research, I am interested in longevity research, history, and space exploration.
