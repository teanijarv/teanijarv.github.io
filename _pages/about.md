I am a final-year Master's student in **Medical Technology and Physics** originally from Estonia :estonia:, but currently work as a research assistant at [the Thompson Institute of University of the Sunshine Coast](https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute) in Australia :australia:.

My current research interests include examining different **electroencephalography (EEG)** methods as biomarkers for **depression**, **suicidality**, **ageing**, and **cognition**. Most of my EEG-related code for signal processing and analysis can be found on my GitHub as [`EEG-pyline: EEG pipeline in Python`](https://github.com/teanijarv/EEG-pyline/). Furthermore, I am eager to learn more about other neuroimaging methods (e.g., fMRI, MRS, MEG), neuromodulation (e.g., TMS, TDCS, DBS), machine learning, and neuroscience in general.

Besides my active involvement with neuroscience and biomedical engineering, I am interested in longetivity research and space exploration. I am sure that all these four fields are one of the most relevant topics throughout the 21st century.

Next milestones for my career are starting a PhD (and finish it!) and work in a neurotech company. I am actively looking for different labs and projects for my PhD journey. :smile:
